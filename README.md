## Analysis of combined continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump delivery data for type 1 diabetes treatment

`DiaTrack` is a compendium of tools aimed to:

1.	Process and temporally integrate CGM data from Freestyle libre and xDrip source with MiniMed pump (Medtronic) and building time-series datasets of interstitial glucose, pump actions, bolus and basal insulin delivery, and estimated insulin in plasma.
2.	Declare unsupervisedly meal and non-meal events, and hyper- and hypoglycemic events and compute variables around them.
3.	Statistically analyze the relation between undeseried events and their variables.
4.	Render novel summarizing diabetes management values and plots.


This work aims to integrate CGM and insulin pump data from type 1 diabetes data in order to identify patterns of diabetes management events and show illustrative plots of combined data sources to provide patients and healthcare givers with additional tools to adjust diabetes management and treatment. The main goal of this project is to give data-based evidence of the patterns of glucose and exogenous insulin levels and facilitate patientsâ€™ adjustment of their disease management.


A tutorial of the use of these tools can be found at [diatrack_pipeline.md](https://github.com/JGarnica22/DiaTrack/blob/main/diatrack_pipeline.md) and [diatrack_pipelin.rmd](https://github.com/JGarnica22/DiaTrack/blob/main/diatrack_pipeline.rmd).
